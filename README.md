# THE PANDEMIC 
### By: Hadia Shafique
## Motivation

My motivation for this project came from the game of rock, paper, scissors. I wanted to give the world a game that has been around for as long as we can imagine reinvisioned. For the past three years COVID has had such an impact on our daily lives, so I decided to implement a game we all grew up loving into something that are world is still facing today.
